# Enigma-Simulator

<h2> Origins </h2>
This is a program I wrote as an IB (International Baccalaureate) Math SL (Standard Level) exploration in in highschool. 

Originally written in Small Basic (the language I was using in my CS course at the time), but I am working on creating a Python implementation 

<h2> Running the Python Version</h2>





<h2>Running the Small Basic version</h2>
Small basic creates an .exe file when you run/compile programs, so I uploaded the created .exe and .dll files:
1. Download both the Enigma.exe and SmallBasicLibrary.dll files from the Enigma-SB folder
1. Run Enigma.exe (-:

If you would rather run/compile it yourself:
1. Download and install [Small Basic](http://smallbasic.com)
1. Download the Enigma.sb 
1. Open Enigma.sb in Small Basic, and click 'Run'
